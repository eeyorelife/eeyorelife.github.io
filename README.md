# Trying to learn Box2D for Processing.

This webpage is wheve I throw up all my half digested thoughts and new insights into Box2D as I figure stuff out. Why am I making it a webpage? And why publicly? Because maybe someone else are having a similarly rough time understanding Box2D for processing, and also, I need a place to organize my thoughts and explain everything to myself. And so I can axcess it later.
